# gstreamer_integrate_simd_gaussian
Integrate the SIMD AVX Gaussian blur into a GStreamer plugin. 
GStreamer has a gaussianblur plugin that you can use, but I 
needed one that made use of the AVX instruction set for a project. 

I will update this README with instructions on how to build the 
entire project from scratch on a later date. 

If you have any questions on how to build all the requirements, please 
feel free to drop me an email: jdgarcia97@proton.me
